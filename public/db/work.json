Users of the site enjoy their time by discovering new games with fresh offers. And by using Pusher we keep them up to date in real time.</p><p>By using modern development techniques such as Webpack's code splitting coupled with es6 asynchronous imports and lazy loading images using IntersectionObserver, I was able to provide an optimized and efficient experience for both mobile and desktop users. The project itself consists of over 150 different components, directives, and custom Vue plugins.</p>",

Because of the clients unique requests, we felt it best to develop a custom CMS powered by Vue to help them manage things.</p><p>Because of Vue's simple yet powerful reactive feature set it was the ideal candidate to help us build a responsive SPA for the CMS. To assist Vue, Laravel is used to do the heavy lifting on the backend and Pusher is integrated to provide users with real time updates. As a final touch, GSAP helps bring life to a unique on boarding experience when users sign up to Casino.eu.</p>",

This become a truly unique project using web technologies to create an immersive experience. Teaming up with the creatives at BRND WGN, I developed a two part web application. The first part was a dashboard interface displayed on a tablet where users were given instructions to interact with. Depending on the stage of the experience video would be either played on the dashboard or on a large mounted flatscreen.</p><p>During the experience coloured lighting would change to go with the videos. This was all powered by a Node.js Express server, WebSockets, and integration with the Phillips HUE api. A custom cueing system was developed to manage the video, audio, and lighting to ensure everything synced up perfectly.</p>",

GO needed this mobile app to work on both phones and tablets as well as both iOS and Android. Naturally we thought this would be a perfect use case for a hybrid app.</p><p>So, with those requirements in mind, I reached to Ionic to help get the job done. Using Angular and integrating a few extra Cordova plugins to access features such as address books, connectivity, and system dialogs, I was able to efficiently develop and turn around a production ready app within a few short weeks.</p>",
